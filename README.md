# mnist-dataset
n this notebook you will learn the MNIST handwritten digit recognition problem and deep learning models developed in Python using the Keras library that are capable of achieving excellent results. Working through this tutorial you will learn: How to load the MNIST dataset in Keras and generate plots of the dataset. How to reshape the MNIST dataset and develop a simple but well performing multi-layer perceptron model on the problem. How to use Keras to create convolutional neural network models for MNIST. How to develop and evaluate larger CNN models for MNIST capable of near world class results.
